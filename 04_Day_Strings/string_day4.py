# STRING
"""
Text is a string data type. Any data type written as text is a string. Any data under single, double or triple quote are strings. T
here are different string methods and built-in functions to deal with string data types. To check the length of a string use the len() method.

# 1. Creating a String

print(letter)               # P
print(len(letter))          # 1
greeting = 'Hello, World!'  # String could be made using a single or double quote,"Hello, World!"

# 2. String Concatenation - Nối chuỗi
# We can connect strings together. Merging or connecting strings is called concatenation. See the example below:
first_name = 'Dang'
last_name = 'Cuong'
space = ' '
full_name = first_name  +  space + last_name
print(full_name) # Asabeneh Yetayeh
# Checking the length of a string using len() built-in function
print(len(first_name))  # 8
print(len(last_name))   # 7
print(len(first_name) > len(last_name)) # True
print(len(full_name)) # 16



# 3. Escape Sequences in Strings
"""
In Python and other programming languages \ followed by a character is an escape sequence. Let us see the most common escape characters:

\n: new line
\t: Tab means(8 spaces)
\\: Back slash
\': Single quote (')
\": Double quote (")
Now, let us see the use of the above escape sequences with examples.
"""
print('I hope everyone is enjoying the Python Challenge.\nAre you ?') # line break
print('Days\tTopics\tExercises') # adding tab space or 4 spaces 
print('Day 1\t3\t5')
print('Day 2\t3\t5')
print('Day 3\t3\t5')
print('Day 4\t3\t5')
print('This is a backslash  symbol (\\)') # To write a backslash
print('In every programming language it starts with \"Hello, World!\"') # to write a double quote inside a single quote

# output
"""I hope every one is enjoying the Python Challenge.
Are you ?

# 4. String formatting

# Old string formatting (Use % operator)

"""
In Python there are many ways of formatting strings. In this section, we will cover some of them. The "%" operator is used to format a set of variables enclosed in a "tuple" (a fixed size list), together with a format string, which contains normal text together with "argument specifiers", special symbols like "%s", "%d", "%f", "%.number of digitsf".

%s - String (or any object with a string representation, like numbers)
%d - Integers
%f - Floating point numbers
"%.number of digitsf" - Floating point numbers with fixed precision

# 5. Python Strings as Sequences of Characters
"""
Python strings are sequences of characters, and share their basic methods of access with other Python ordered sequences of objects – lists and tuples.
 The simplest way of extracting single characters from strings (and individual members from any sequence) is to unpack them into corresponding variables.

Unpacking Characters
"""
language = 'Python'
a,b,c,d,e,f = language # unpacking sequence characters into variables
print(a) # P
print(b) # y
print(c) # t
print(d) # h
print(e) # o
print(f) # n



# 6. Accessing Characters in Strings by Index
# In programming counting starts from zero. Therefore the first letter of a string is at zero index and the last letter of a string is the length of a string minus one.
language = 'Python'
first_letter = language[0]
print(first_letter) # P
second_letter = language[1]
print(second_letter) # y
last_index = len(language) - 1
last_letter = language[last_index]
print(last_letter) # n

# If we want to start from right end we can use negative indexing. -1 is the last index.
language = 'Python'
last_letter = language[-1]
print(last_letter) # n
second_last = language[-2]
print(second_last) # o



# Slicing Python Strings
language = 'Python'
first_three = language[0:3] # starts at zero index and up to 3 but not include 3
print(first_three) #Pyt
last_three = language[3:6]
print(last_three) # hon
# Another way
last_three = language[-3:]
print(last_three)   # hon
